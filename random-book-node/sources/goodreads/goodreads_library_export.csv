This book is a sober reminder that anyone can become bigoted. It has inspired me to look deeper into the issues and take less at face value, including this book.<br/><br/>After further reflection, I'm going to go further and say this book is not scientifically rigorous. While it makes interesting points, there is lots of laziness. An example is Shellenberger's assertion that rising levels of anxiety among younger generations are a direct cause of environmental alarmism. While I won't rule it out, it's far from the only factor at play (cough, cough, Social Media) and at the very least a vast oversimplification.",,,1,0
