# decision-making-experiments
A collection of my experiments in making software to improve decisions. My thesis is that I choose most things rather thoughtlessly and randomly, riddled with cognitive biases. I hope that by creating tuneable algorithms to support my decisions, I can iteratively improve them. 

## Inspiration

The books that inform my thinking on the topic include:
- Thinking Fast & Slow
- A Righteous Mind
- The Black Swan
- Noise

## Current Projects

Right now I'm focused on decisions as they pertain to: 
- Articles
- Books
- Products
- Movies
- Cities
- Restaurants
- Writing

The project that is furthest along is related to article selection. I currently have a cache of 25,000+ articles I've bookmarked for later reading. I use a weighted choice algorithm to help me choose what to read. My other experiments are more simplistic, leveraging randomness in most cases to mix up my decisions and eliminate simple biases. 

Why randomness? In Noise, by Daniel Kahneman, randomness is held up as a way to reduce bias. It increases noise, but it reduces bias. Until I can better tune my "bias" to be for quality content, I choose noise. 

## Notes

In addition to using software to make better input decisions, I'm using software to streamline my outputs. I'm currently working on two "output" projects: 

- Last Week I Learned (newsletter & podcast)
- Jimmy Has Problems (YouTube channel)

I've got a little bit of software in here to streamline the creation of these outputs. To "close the loop" I also have a simple search setup to help me surface articles I might find interesting. There is no UI for that right now, simply a script in Typescript.
