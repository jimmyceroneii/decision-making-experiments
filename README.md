# decision-making-experiments
A collection of my experiments in making software to improve decisions. 

Right now I'm focused on decisions as they pertain to: 
- Articles
- Books
- Products

To start, I'm just using randomness as the decision criteria. Going forward I hope to add more ways to decide.
