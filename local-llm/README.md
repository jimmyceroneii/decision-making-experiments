Why is there a local LLM folder in here? Well a lot of the decision making stuff I want to do ends up using LLMs and they are EXPENSIVE. So I'm digging around for ways I can use these tools for myself without breaking the bank. I may not self host or run locally, but I'm looking into the possibility. 

For now, I'm using Replicate, which lets me run a variety of models as a REST API. Good stuff.
