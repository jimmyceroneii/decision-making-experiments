## City Picker

Choosing the city in which you live is one of the most important decisions you can make. A rising tide lifts all boats. Choosing a growing industry is the best choice you can make for your career. Choosing a growing city (or an already great one) is another way to maximize your chances. 

Most of us choose where we live in dubious ways. We pick where our families live, where we get our first job. We have good reason for choosing easily. Moving is hard. The payoff may be high, but so is the cost. 

When picking a place to live, we ought to be more like Amazon picking a new headquarters. Thorough, choosy, and thoughtful. Unfortunately for us, data about cities is hard to come by. We must rely on word of mouth, our own limited experience, and the news. 

I've identified a couple of potential starting data sources for this work, but in the end I plan on producing much of my own data. 

## Bright Spots
- [API Ninjas City API](https://api-ninjas.com/api/city)
- [City Data](https://www.city-data.com/)
- [City SDK](https://uscensusbureau.github.io/citysdk/)
- [US Census](https://data.census.gov/)

An existing product I find inspiring is: [Nomad List](https://nomadlist.com/). My goal is to create a more filter oriented qualitative version of Nomad List that is more flexible for folks beyond just digital nomads.
