To me the explanation flows directly from Strategy 101: Apple Intelligence is the application of generative AI to use cases and content that Apple is uniquely positioned to provide and access. It is designed, to build on yesterday‚Äôs Article, to maximize the advantages that Apple has in terms of being the operating system provider on your phone; and, on the other hand, what it is not is any sort of general purpose chatbot: that is where OpenAI comes in‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâand only there. [‚Ä¶]\nTo put it another way, and in Stratechery terms, Apple is positioning itself as an AI Aggregator: the company owns users and, by extension, generative AI demand by virtue of owning its platforms, and it is deepening its moat through Apple Intelligence, which only Apple can do; that demand is then being brought to bear on suppliers who probably have to eat the costs of getting privileged access to Apple‚Äôs userbase.\n\nIt pains me to admit how great a take this is.

This made the feature less useful for developers or\nusers hoping to test iCloud features in macOS, or whose apps rely\non some kind of syncing with iCloud, or people who just wanted\neasy access to their iCloud data from within a VM.\nThis limitation is going away in macOS 15 Sequoia, according to\ndeveloper documentation that Apple released yesterday. As\nlong as your host operating system is macOS 15 or newer and your\nguest operating system is macOS 15 or newer, VMs will now be able\nto sign into and use iCloud and other Apple ID-related services\njust as they would when running directly on the hardware.\n\nNice change.

This seems to be a recurring story in enterprise software projects written in Go, but I digress. This time, the question is: how to do proper database transaction management, the idiomatic Go way? The thing we were trying to solve must have been solved more than a thousand times before, by others using Go, but also by others using classic object-oriented languages such as C# and Java.\nIn Java, we simply rely on Spring and JPA and Hibernate andWhatever-Its-Called-Now to conjure up a piece of middleware that automagically opens up and commits or rolls back the transaction. This is typically done using Aspect Oriented Programming. If the framework works‚Äîand that‚Äôs usually the point of a frame work‚Äîall the programmer has to do is to add @Transactional on top of a method:\n@Transactional\npublic void SaveInvoice(Invoice invoice) {\n    if(!invoice.validate()) {\n        throw new InvoiceInvalidException();\n    ...",

    "summary": "The text from \"On Bullshit\" discusses the concept of humbug and its relation to lying and bullshit. It explores how humbug involves deceptive misrepresentation, short of lying, especially by pretentious word or deed, of one's own thoughts, feelings, or attitudes. The text also delves into the nature of bullshit, highlighting that it is not necessarily false but rather phony, with the bullshitter faking things and being indifferent to the truth. Bullshitting is compared to lying, with the former often being seen as more tolerated than the latter. The text concludes by discussing why there is so much bullshit, attributing it to situations where people talk without knowing what they are talking about due to excessive obligations or opportunities to speak on a topic.",

    "summary": "Marc Brooker, an engineer at Amazon Web Services, discusses the concept of exponential value at linear cost in computing. He explains that certain aspects of computing, such as binary search and redundancy, offer exponential value in relation to the amount of effort required. However, he also notes that this powerful effect of redundancy only works when the redundant components fail independently. If there is correlation between their failures, the system's availability is significantly reduced. System designers must be aware of this and consider it when designing distributed systems.",

By creating a data pipeline with shell commands, all processing steps can be done in parallel, resulting in faster performance. Shell commands like grep and awk can be used to filter and process data efficiently. The author demonstrates this by comparing the speed of processing chess game data using Hadoop versus command-line tools. The command-line tools were able to process the same amount of data 235 times faster than the Hadoop implementation. The author suggests that for many data processing tasks, using simple shell commands and tools on a single machine can be more efficient and cost-effective than using complex distributed processing systems like Hadoop.",

Even in this case, there was no agreement on what should be allowed or not. Disagreements increase when dealing with charged issues, making it almost impossible for large platforms to satisfy user preferences and moderate content effectively.",

Although bandwidth has increased exponentially, CPU performance for web apps hasn't scaled nearly as quickly, which makes it difficult for people with low-end devices even if they have high-end connections. Slow pages are often super-linearly slow as devices get slower, and slowness on one page doesn't strongly predict slowness on another page. Slow devices or any device with low bandwidth and/or poor connectivity work best when using lightweight, static pages that load a lot of content at once.",

It highlights the convention that checkboxes are square and radio buttons are round, which has been followed by major operating system vendors for decades. However, the introduction of the web and CSS led to the reinvention and redesign of these controls, with examples of checkboxes containing checkmarks and square radio buttons. Despite the chaos and temptation on the web, operating system vendors have mostly adhered to the convention. However, Apple has recently abandoned this tradition in their new visionOS by introducing round checkboxes. The document concludes by stating that the era of the square checkbox has come to an end.",

I‚Äôve made my own classes usable as keys and know that there are multiple equality methods. With this understanding I decided to try and make strange Hash instances.\nStrange Hash #1: Non-unique keys\nHow about a hash that only allows one value for any Integer key regardless of the integer value? From the documentation it seems that this is as simple as changing Integer#hash to always return the same value and Integer#eql? to always return true:\nclass Integer\n   def eql?(other)\n     true\n   end\n\n  def hash\n     0\n  end\nend\n\ntable = {}\ntable[1] = 'one'\ntable[5] = 'five'\nputs table\n#=> {1=>\"one\", 5=>\"five\"}\n\nStrange, that wasn‚Äôt what I expected.

I don‚Äôt actually know Lua, but luckily I spent most of my investigation in a debugger or C source code.\nOne of the first things that jumped out at me was that there didn‚Äôt seem to be any mention of siphash in the Lua source code. Ruby and Python use siphash with a per-session key to generate hashes. You can easily verify that the hash of a string changes in different Ruby sessions:\n$ irb\nirb(main):001:0> \"hello!\".hash\n=> -3270480275822396260\nirb(main):002:0> exit\n$ irb\nirb(main):001:0> \"hello!\".hash\n=> -4583553666733776547\n\nUsing a debugger, I saw that strings in Lua also have different hashes between different sessions.

The basic idea is to wrap a protected function call in a circuit breaker object that monitors for failures. Once the failures reach a certain threshold, the circuit breaker trips and all further calls return with an error. The circuit breaker can also detect when the underlying calls are working again and reset itself. This pattern is useful in situations where you want to protect parts of a system from failures in other parts, and it can be implemented in various programming languages.",

The study also highlights that Google provides quick answers through various search features, leading to zero-click searches. The methodology of the study involved analyzing a sample of 20,000 U.S. desktop and mobile users and over 600,000 search queries.

In that last study, sleep regularity was found to be a better predictor of mortality than sleep duration, while another study looking at factors that predict mortality in older men found sleep rhythmicity to be the highest ranking sleep-related factor, ranking fifth. Sleep duration, on the other hand, only showed up about 18 spots further down the list. Does this mean sleep duration doesn‚Äôt matter? Of course not. Does it mean we need a definition of sleep health that includes regularity and rhythmicity? Sure seems that way. ",

You can think of this gradual drop-off in sleep duration as capturing a washing-out of sleep debt. And if people sleeping 7 to 8 hours a night had sleep to catch up on, surely the rest of us are doomed.

The Railroad made it possible to cross the country in a matter of days instead of months, paved the way for new settlers to come out west, and helped speed America's entry onto the world stage as a modern nation that spanned a full continent.

The Railroad could not have been built without Chinese labor, but the lives of Chinese railroad workers themselves have been little understood and largely invisible.\n\nThis landmark volume explores the experiences of Chinese railroad workers and their place in cultural...",

It allows a single task to be replaced with a variable number of other tasks, based on specific conditions. This pattern is useful when tasks need to be executed in a dynamic workflow or when tasks need to be generated based on external data. The fanout pattern can help reduce the complexity of task signatures and make them more descriptive and easier to extend or reproduce.",

They also discuss the iterative process of editing the tool on the fly and the joy of having a personalized GUI that can be easily modified. The author concludes by reflecting on the value of affordances and the potential for LLMs to support non-programmers in building custom GUIs.",

    "summary": "This text is a guide for implementing Service Level Objectives (SLOs) for SREs and DevOps teams, outlining the process in three steps: identifying the service level, selecting the SLO type, and setting SLO targets. It explains key SLO terminologies like SLI, SLO, and SLA, and provides practical advice on choosing between request-based and window-based SLOs based on service characteristics and goals. The text emphasizes starting conservatively with SLO targets, considering compliance windows, and setting latency values based on user experience, while also highlighting the importance of monitoring and adjusting SLOs to ensure system reliability and customer satisfaction.",

    "summary": "The author reflects on how society's definition of \"normal\" has shifted over time, with a trend towards labeling individuals as pathological for not fitting into societal norms. This shift towards celebrating marginalized identities has led to an industry of mental health professionals eager to diagnose and medicate behaviors that were once considered within the realm of normal. The author advocates for a broader acceptance of human diversity and a reduction in unnecessary labeling and medical interventions.",

However, the author is skeptical of this claim, as temperamental and mysterious system behavior would drive users away from products. The article explores the possibility of AI being used as a software developer, with the AI either asking the product manager about individual choices and ambiguities or consistently correctly guessing the right answer. The author suggests that when looking at claims that AI will automate a process, we should consider the inherent complexity of that process and whether it would be successful with uncertainty injected into that complexity.",

Instead of focusing on labels, it's more important to consider the functional characteristics and how they help achieve goals. The author also suggests embracing the spectrum of serverless technologies instead of arguing about specific boundaries. While the term may be losing meaning, the underlying concepts are still valuable.",

The site offered a combination of free and paid articles about AWS Serverless, with the hope of attracting readers with the free content and upselling them on the paid articles. However, the monetization model and the restrictive content format proved to be failures. The lack of a trial or free preview for paid articles and the limited scope of the content led to low revenue generation. Additionally, Vandonkersgoed's decision to build his own platform instead of using an existing product, like WordPress, consumed valuable time that could have been spent on writing content. Ultimately, he has decided to return to his roots and run his personal website on WordPress.com, focusing on writing different types of content without plans for monetization.",

This requires developers to understand the impact of choosing different statically configured primitives, which can be challenging when also trying to be competent in multiple programming languages and cloud services. Platform engineering has emerged to allow developers to be more productive while maintaining security, performance, and cost. However, many developers may not have the time or desire to invest in learning new services and keeping up with the latest features. While serverless has its advantages, upskilling organizations to effectively deploy serverless applications can take years of experimentation and learning.

These gene banks are crucial for ensuring food security and providing resources for future generations. While initiatives like the Svalbard Global Seed Vault provide backup storage for seeds, it is important to cultivate and consume diverse varieties to maintain resilience in the face of soil degradation, pests, and climate change. Supporting regenerative agriculture practices and embracing traditional ecological knowledge can help preserve biodiversity and sustain food production. Ultimately, the true source of agrobiodiversity lies in the soil, and it is important to prioritize the cultivation and consumption of diverse species to safeguard our food system.",

    "summary": "Edward Said, a renowned critic of Western narratives and a professor of English and comparative literature at Columbia University, gradually developed his post-colonialist convictions. In his influential book \"Orientalism,\" Said critiqued Western intellectual culture and its representation of the Orient. While the book expanded the fields of anti-colonial and post-colonial studies, it also faced criticism for its Eurocentrism and lack of awareness of non-Western thought. Said later became disillusioned with theory and derided the \"jaw-shattering jargonistic postmodernisms\" of scholars like Jacques Derrida. He also collaborated with conductor Daniel Barenboim to create an orchestra of Arab and Israeli musicians, which sparked controversy among Palestinians.",

Recently, there's a trend to combine this traditional monitoring with a broader view of system quality to understand if the system is behaving as expected. By implementing production monitoring tools and a Continuous Delivery pipeline, teams can detect issues promptly and enhance system quality through production QA practices. Techniques like logging and metrics gathering, along with setting up alerts and dashboards, are crucial for reacting to production issues effectively and improving system performance.",

    "summary": "When communicating with an external service, using a test double can prevent slow and unreliable tests. However, this raises the question of whether the double accurately represents the external service and what happens if the service changes its contract. Running a separate set of contract tests periodically can ensure that calls to the test doubles return the same results as a call to the external service. A failure in a contract test triggers a task to update the tests and code to bring them back into consistency with the external service. Communication with the external service supplier is important, especially if the service is being used as part of a production application.",

It's important to carefully think about how we integrate new technologies into our lives and work, rather than simply embracing them because they are more efficient.

    "summary": "Integration tests are used to determine if independently developed units of software work correctly when they are connected to each other. However, there is confusion around the term \"integration test\" and its scope. In the past, integration testing involved combining modules into the entire system or significant sub-systems to test their interactions. Nowadays, a narrower approach to integration testing is becoming more popular, where only the portion of code interacting with a separate service is tested using test doubles. This approach offers faster testing and easier integration with external services. However, there are still developers who only understand integration tests as broad tests that require live versions of all services. It is important to clarify the terminology and consider the benefits of narrow integration testing.",

    "summary": "The Ivory Coast's economy was largely based on cocoa, coffee, timber, and French investment. The country had a diverse resource-based economy that employed both its own people and immigrants. The success of the Ivory Coast was attributed to the leadership of F√©lix Houphou√´t-Boigny (FHB), who emphasized national Ivorian identity over ethnic division.

The government's diversification efforts also favored French owners and managers, leading to a disproportionate amount of income going to foreigners. Ultimately, the Ivory Coast became a resource state where elite politicians looted the economy, leaving the majority of the population behind.",

    "summary": "Peru's culinary scene has gained international recognition for its fusion cuisine, influenced by Indigenous traditions, Spanish colonists, and Japanese and Chinese immigrants. However, there is a new trend in Peru that has been largely overlooked: Venezuelan-Peruvian cuisine. The recent influx of Venezuelan immigrants, driven by economic and political crises in Venezuela, has led to the creation of new dishes that bridge the culinary divide. Venezuelan-Peruvian fusion can be seen in casual restaurants like Teque√±o Lab, where traditional Venezuelan teque√±os are filled with Peruvian aj√≠ de gallina, and in more upscale establishments like M√©rito, where refined dishes like choclo a la brasa showcase the fusion of Peruvian and Venezuelan flavors. These culinary creations not only represent a delicious silver lining for migrants, but also have the potential to foster cultural understanding and cooperation.",

It retrieves metrics from the baseline and canary clusters and uses a series of steps, including data validation, cleaning, metric comparison, and score computation, to determine if the canary passed or failed. Kayenta is designed to be flexible and pluggable, and it is currently being used for approximately 30% of Netflix's production canary judgments.",

Outside researchers who attempted to verify those claims have, in a new perspective paper published in Chemical Materials, expressed serious misgivings about that claim. A team selected a random sample of the 384,870 proposed structure and found that not a single one met a three-part test of being credible, useful or novel. They also call out 18,000 proposed compounds that contain elements that are only available in minute quantities, or are far too radioactive to actually have any utility whatsoever in materials science. DeepMind stands by its paper. ",

The dielectric film placed between the chip and the structure underneath is produced as an incredibly thin sheet, and for the past three decades a single Japanese company has had over 90 percent market share in dielectric film. That company is Ajinomoto, which connoisseurs may better know as the company that is the leading global supplier of MSG seasoning powder. In the ‚Äò90s, Ajinomoto found that one of the byproducts of MSG production was a dielectric insulator, and thus a monopoly was born. They have nothing whatsoever to do with making computer chips beyond this one thing. Given recent investments in chips, some new companies intend to challenge Ajinomoto‚Äôs domination in the market.

    "summary": "Continuous Delivery is the practice of safely and quickly getting changes, such as new features and bug fixes, into production or the hands of users. The goal is to make deployments predictable and routine by ensuring that code is always in a deployable state. This eliminates the need for integration, testing, and code freezes. Continuous Delivery offers several benefits, including low-risk releases, faster time to market, higher quality, lower costs, and better products. It also leads to happier teams by reducing the pain associated with software delivery and allowing for more frequent engagement with users. Continuous Delivery is not a magic solution, but rather a continuous improvement process that aims for higher performance.",

    "summary": "Canary release is a technique used to reduce the risk of introducing a new software version in production by gradually rolling it out to a small subset of users before making it available to everyone. This method allows for capacity testing in a production environment with a safe rollback strategy if issues arise. Companies employ various strategies, such as targeting specific user groups or regions, to implement canary releases effectively. While similar to A/B testing, canary releases focus on detecting problems and regressions, making them distinct approaches for software deployment.",

Canary deployments involve gradually rolling out updates to a controlled subset of users, reducing risk and allowing for early feedback and adjustments. The article introduces a novel canary deployment architecture that leverages AWS CloudFront, S3, and Lambda@Edge to simplify the deployment process and ensure robust monitoring capabilities. The proposed architecture utilizes CloudFront as a content delivery network, S3 for object storage, and Lambda@Edge for custom logic processing. The article provides a step-by-step process for implementing canary deployments and highlights the benefits of this approach for web application development.",

It discusses how enforcing certain limitations, such as a no-laptops policy, can create a different kind of freedom and interaction among people.

Despite their importance, building airports is a challenging endeavor due to opposition from various interest groups and the complexities of noise pollution and environmental impacts. The expansion of air travel driven by jet aircraft in the mid-20th century necessitated significant infrastructure development, leading to noise complaints and regulatory challenges. While advancements in engine technology and regulatory measures have addressed some issues, airport construction and expansion continue to face resistance from local residents, environmental concerns, and airline interests.",

Routines consist of consistent activities done at the same time, while schedules can vary day to day and include specific time slots for tasks. Routines offer benefits such as maximizing time, encouraging healthy habits, relieving stress, and ensuring time for what matters. Schedules provide a framework for the day, help avoid procrastination, increase productivity, boost work-life balance, and promote progress towards goals. When creating routines and schedules, it's important to personalize them, set goals, prioritize tasks, and make adjustments as needed.

    "summary": "The purpose of life is to achieve the complete expression of one's true self. Each person has a unique essence waiting to be fully realized, but external influences can dilute this expression. It is important to not only discover who you are but also maximize and embody your truest self. The world is like a mirror, reflecting back distorted versions of ourselves. Through the consumption and synthesis of these reflections, we can connect to our inner source code and understand our place and role in the world. Despite the imperfections of life, the pursuit of self-discovery and self-expression is a profound purpose.",

    "summary": "The article discusses a study on muscle-building through resistance training, focusing on the impact of sets on muscle growth. The research found that increasing the number of sets led to greater muscle gain, especially for those initially classified as non-responders to resistance training. While more sets benefited muscle size, strength gains, as measured by one-rep max, did not significantly differ between one set and four sets, highlighting the complexities of muscle development. The study suggests that individual responses to training vary, emphasizing the need for personalized approaches in strength training to achieve desired outcomes.",

It is not a lack of technical knowledge and related competencies that makes one get stuck in their mid-career ‚Äî it is the lack of an understanding of their power, the power of others, and then not developing their sources of power and using those to influence others to get things done ‚Äî is what gets you stuck often. This stuckness starts with an improper understanding of ‚Äúpower‚Äù and ‚Äúinfluence‚Äù and subsequently not recognizing and appreciating your power and that of others. Based on an ad hoc sample, I can tell that many people at work secretly hope that power doesn‚Äôt exist and stay away from it, which is sad and career-limiting.\nWhy is this usually a mid-career phenomenon? In the early-career phase, your technical competencies get you the job and, perhaps, a few promotions. By technical, I don‚Äôt mean competencies ...",

Their innovative approach involves capturing CO2 onboard ships to create clean fuel, addressing the challenges of sourcing affordable CO2 for fuel production. Seabound's unique carbon capture technology converts CO2 into limestone onboard, simplifying the process by completing the separation and liquefaction onshore. The company aims to transform the shipping industry by providing sustainable solutions and hopes to see carbon-negative ships on the water within the next decade. Their plans include using recent funding to accelerate product development and commercialization to meet the increasing demands for green shipping solutions.",

The current web experience lacks the qualities of shared physical space and the ability to be aware of others in real-time. However, advancements in internet speeds and bandwidth have allowed for real-time experiences like collaborative editing and live streaming. The concept of ambient co-presence, where people share a space without direct interaction, is still relatively unexplored in the digital realm. Multiplayer cursors and spatial audio are potential solutions, but further exploration is needed to achieve a softer, ambient sense of shared presence.",

It uses Markdown as the default lightweight markup language, but also supports Org-mode syntax. Logseq is block-oriented, allowing for the addition of metadata to each block and easy linking between blocks and pages. The tool offers features like collapsible blocks, queries, templates, and plugins for added functionality. However, Logseq does have some limitations compared to Org-mode, such as the lack of Elisp customization, appointments, and certain editing functions. Overall, Logseq provides a user-friendly interface and useful features for organizing and navigating information.",

    "summary": "The author discusses their work on the Summer of Protocols project and the launch of the Protocol Kit, which aims to promote the study of protocols in all areas of life. The study of protocols is the study of hardness, in the sense of both diamonds and difficulty, and protocols are engineered hardness. The concept of hardness is important in the search for durability and predictability in an uncertain world. The author argues that thinking explicitly in terms of hardness and protocols can be a powerful tool for analysis and synthesis, and offers fresh insight into almost any domain.",

While some people have embraced extreme versions of Waldenponding, such as living off the grid, the author argues that it is not a sustainable or beneficial philosophy. Instead, the document suggests that withdrawing from information flows can also leave individuals vulnerable to having their attention controlled by different fears, such as FOBO (Fear Of Being Ordinary), which is explored as an alternative viewpoint to FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). The text challenges the idea of Waldenponding as a valid approach to managing attention in the digital age.",

He provides examples from science and mathematics, such as the discovery of electromagnetic waves by Heinrich Hertz and the development of group theory. Flexner also highlights how seemingly aimless work, such as Ehrlich's microscopic observations, can eventually lead to practical applications, such as in medicine. He emphasizes the importance of cultivating curiosity and not solely focusing on immediate practical uses.",

    "summary": "This paper discusses the challenge of efficiently running large language models (LLMs) with limited DRAM capacity by storing model parameters on flash memory and bringing them on demand to DRAM. The authors propose an inference cost model that optimizes data transfer and reading data in larger chunks. They introduce two techniques, \"windowing\" and \"row-column bundling,\" to reduce data transfer and increase flash memory throughput. These methods allow LLMs to run models up to twice the size of available DRAM and achieve significant increases in inference speed. The paper also addresses the characteristics of flash memory and the challenges of LLM inference on resource-constrained devices.",

    "summary": "\"The Making of Arrested Development was a Sh*t Show (Pt 1: Critically Ill-Fated)\" tells the story of the critically acclaimed sitcom and the challenges it faced during its production. The show was inspired by the rise of reality TV and aimed to revolutionize the sitcom genre. The pilot script was bought by 20th Century Fox, and the show gained a reputation for its unique visual style and unconventional storytelling. Despite positive reviews and Emmy wins, Arrested Development struggled to find a wide audience, and Fox attempted to make the series more accessible in its second season. However, the show ultimately faced cancellation due to low ratings and network priorities.",

    "summary": "The author reflects on the decline of friendships in their life and the lives of others, particularly in their 30s. They attribute this decline to various factors, such as moving away from established social networks, becoming introverted, and the changing dynamics of urban millennial friendships. The author also discusses the impact of modern technology, burnout, and the lack of low-effort, regular social interactions on the quality of friendships. They argue that the current societal emphasis on self-optimization and individualism is detrimental to the human need for social connection and support. The author concludes by suggesting that we need to reorient our lives around the idea of relying on and caring for others, rather than attempting to self-optimize and isolate ourselves.",

The essay discusses the central principles that wise investors employ and how they have earned extraordinary returns by investing in the unknown and the unknowable. Those who lack the skills can look for \"sidecar\" investments that allow them to put their money alongside that of people they know to be both capable and honest. The essay also looks at behavioral economics, the tendency for humans to deviate in systematic ways from rational decision, particularly when probabilities are involved, to unearth successful investment strategies.",

Notes are classified into Fleeting Notes, Literature Notes, and Permanent Notes. The purpose of a Zettelkasten is not to find individual notes but to explore connections among notes and assign keywords to them. The method can be applied to digital or paper-based notes and helps users remember what they read, know what to read next, and develop ideas.",

She emphasizes the importance of incorporating art and culture into the development of robotics to create harmonious and dynamic interactions between humans and robots. Cuan's projects, such as Music Mode and Project Starling, have successfully demonstrated the potential for robots to evoke emotions and create novel experiences.",

Brach compares this practice to saving money in a bank account, as revisiting these memories pays dividends and provides energy during low moments. These memories act as a map that guides individuals when they feel lost, reminding them of their values and what truly matters to them.",

    "summary": "David Foster Wallace reflects on responsibility and maturity, noting that there is a tendency for his generation to still see themselves as children. He discusses the concept of the wounded inner child and how it relates to a popular psychological movement in the United States. Wallace also explores the mixed messages young people receive in American culture about being grown-up, with a focus on gratifying personal desires while also being a responsible citizen. He expresses concern about the increasing hostility towards reading and quiet contemplation in American culture, driven by the fast-paced nature of computer and internet culture. Wallace discusses his fear of the consequences of the country's actions and its lack of awareness of the connection between its way of life and the events happening globally. He suggests that meaningful rebellion does not necessarily involve action and force, but rather quiet individualism and critical thinking.",
