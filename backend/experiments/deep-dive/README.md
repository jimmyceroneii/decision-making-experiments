I've written about my concept of shallow and deep dives before. That article
no longer exists on the internet. I'll publish it again at some point,
but for now it's enough to say that my article experiment is for shallow dives.

Shallow dives are passing curiosities. They are all about exploration. The goal is to
discover topics I might want to deep dive on.

My first attempt at deep dives failed. It left me exhausted. I tried to pick a topic in advance,
build up a cache of articles, and then write about them. It was effective to some degree.

I ended up doing like 5 deep dives with corresponding podcasts for a few of them. I love the output format. But the process of making these needs to change.
Same with the time scale. I cannot crank these out in one week.

My theory now is that the timescale and the deterministic nature of these sunk the ship. So I'm trying to do deep dives on a monthly scale.

Instead of picking them ahead of time, I'm letting them bubble up from the reading I already do. I am working on writing about topics I find interesting
every day. From those topics, I hope that I will end up with a deep dive or two. My hope is that by doing a consistent process,
I can end up with deep dives. I'm not sure if that will be enough. But we shall see.
