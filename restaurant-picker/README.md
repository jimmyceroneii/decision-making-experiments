I've done a little prior work on this problem with Neil Weeda. We created a rudimentary round robin system using React. There's plenty of work to do here. I'll be reviving what we built and attempting to add to it. 

Similar to the city picking problem, data is tricky here. Most of the data is silohed (Yelp, Google) and stuck in list or map format. I don't think lists or maps are the right visualization for this problem. I'm not sure of the right one yet, but I'll be trying a few things along the way.
