## Random Articles

In Matter, my reading app, I've got a backlog of 14,000 articles. It is hard to decide what to read next. I am bombarded by new content via their RSS / email solution as well. I want to make my workflow easier, separating the deciding I want to read something from the deciding what I want to read. 

I want my inbox to be all yes no decisions. I want a separate way to filter what gets in to my queue. For now, I'm using randomness. I've set this up so that every day, a random article is sent to my inbox along with 10 similar links. 

I am using Resend to send the email, Exa.ai to find the similar links, and a simple shuffle function to pick the link.
