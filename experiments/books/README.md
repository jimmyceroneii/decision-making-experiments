## Random Book

I've got over 500 books in my Goodreads backlog. I have no idea how to decide which book to read next. There are a variety of approaches I'm interested in trying out, but for now I'm keeping it simple with randomness. At some regular cadence, I will be sent a book from my queue as a suggestion.

For now, I'm using Goodreads to keep track of books. In the future, I'd like to use Readwise Reader and tags to set this up. Goodreads sucks and it's not worth the UI.

I've setup a Readwise `books` tag. I have not implemented it as part of this project. So far this project has been a failure.
I do not use the weekly recommended book to decide what to read next. Rather, I use going to the library, what is available on Libby, or friend's recommendations to pick.

That is not optimal (noisy and biased), but I'm not sure I've got a better way at this point.

The technologies I plan on using here are:

- Resend for emails
- Goodreads export
- GitHub Actions for cron
- Alibris to send book buying link
