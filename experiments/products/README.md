## Random Products

I love to try new products of any kind, but SaaS products in particular. I've bookmarked hundreds of products to try out in the past year. How do I decide which are worth trying? It's a work in progress. I'm starting by using randomness to decide, informed by the thought of Daniel Kahneman and his work on bias. 

My list of products comes from a list in Apple Reminders. I'm migrating to using Matter and tags to manage the products. For now, the app does the following: 

- Grabs a random product using a simple shuffle
- Finds similar products using the Exa.ai API
- Finds news stories about the product using the Exa.ai API

In the future, I'll use Resend to send an email via GitHub Actions according to some publishing cadence for YouTube reviews I do.
